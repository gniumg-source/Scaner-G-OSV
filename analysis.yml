Call analysis in Rust
Experimental
Call analysis in Rust is still considered experimental.

Running call analysis for Rust will execute build scripts (build.rs) in your dependencies as part of the compilation. This may execute arbitrary code.

OSV-Scanner compiles Rust source code and analyzes the output binary’s DWARF debug information to identify called vulnerable functions.

Additional Dependencies
Rust toolchain (including cargo) that can compile the source code being scanned needs to be installed and available on PATH.

The installed Rust toolchain must be capable of compiling every crate/target in the scanned code, for code with a lot of dependencies this will take a few minutes.

Limitations
Current implementation has a few limitations:

Does not support dependencies on proc-macros (Tracked in #464)
Does not support any dependencies that are dynamically linked
Does not support dependencies that link external non-rust code
Example
osv-scanner scan source --call-analysis=rust --no-call-analysis=go ./my/project/path
